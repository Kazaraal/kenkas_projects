PubKeyAuthentication
Set up your client

1. Generate your key.
ssh-keygen

2. Configure ssh to use the key. This is to be done in your home directory's .ssh!!!
vim home/ubuntu/.ssh/config

Your config file should have something similar to the following:

Host SERVERNAME
Hostname ip-or-domain-of-server
User USERNAME
PubKeyAuthentication yes
IdentityFile ./path/to/key


You can add IdentitiesOnly yes to ensure ssh uses the specified IdentityFile and no other keyfiles during authentication. Setting IdentitiesOnly prevents failed authentications from occurring, when ssh would otherwise attempt to login with multiple keys. Setting this is also considered more secure, as you're not leaking information about other keys you have installed, and maintaining separation of your keys between different levels of access.

3. Copy your key to your server.

ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/key.pub SERVERNAME`
For example, ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_res.pub -p 22 user@1.1.1.1


Troubleshooting

use "-vvv" option
Make sure the server has your PUBLIC key (.pub).
Make sure your IdentiyFile points to your PRIVATE key.
Make sure your .ssh directory has 700 and the files within are 600 permissions.
ssh-keygen will create files and directories for you with the proper permissions
tail -f /var/log/auth.log (on the server) and monitor errors when you attempt to login
If you have many key files, try IdentitiesOnly yes to limit the authentication to use the single, specified key.
